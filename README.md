# Airbnb
# Airbnb-like Listing and Review Platform

## Overview

This project is a web application inspired by Airbnb, built using **MongoDB**, **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **Bootstrap** for the front-end. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) listings and reviews. The application also includes user authentication and follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture for a clean and organized codebase.

---

## Features

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Users can sign up, log in, and log out.
   - Passwords are securely hashed using **bcrypt**.
   - Authentication is managed using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** or **session-based authentication**.

2. **Listings Management**:
   - **Create**: Users can add new listings with details like title, description, price, location, and images.
   - **Read**: Listings are displayed on the homepage with pagination and filtering options.
   - **Update**: Users can edit their own listings.
   - **Delete**: Users can remove their listings.

3. **Reviews Management**:
   - **Create**: Users can leave reviews for listings theyâ€™ve booked or visited.
   - **Read**: Reviews are displayed on the listing details page.
   - **Update**: Users can edit their reviews.
   - **Delete**: Users can delete their reviews.

4. **MVC Architecture**:
   - **Models**: Define the structure of data (e.g., `User`, `Listing`, `Review`).
   - **Views**: Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap** for responsive design.
   - **Controllers**: Handle the logic for routing, authentication, and CRUD operations.

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - The front-end is designed using **Bootstrap** and custom **CSS** to ensure a seamless experience across devices.
